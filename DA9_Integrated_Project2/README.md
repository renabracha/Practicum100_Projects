# Project Description

A startup that sells food products wants to investigate user behavior for the company's app.

Study the sales funnel to find out how users reach the purchase stage. How many users actually make it to this stage? How many get stuck at previous stages? Which stages in particular?

Look at the results of an A/A/B test. The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. Find out which set of fonts produces better results, based on the outcome of an A/A/B test.
