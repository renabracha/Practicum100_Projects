# Project Description

A new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts is
developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. The goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. 

Using a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling,  build a model for classifying positive reviews.

Note: imdb_reviews.tsv is 66.5MG in size, so it is compressed and available as a .rar file in the datasets folder of the project.
