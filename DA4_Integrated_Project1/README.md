# Project Description

An online store sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. 

Identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow you to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.
