# Practicum100 by Yandex Projects

This repository showcases the Data Analysis and Data Science projects I tackled and had them reviewed by the course instructors. 

Programming Language: Python with various libraries including scikit-learn for data analysis and modeling, and Matplotlib Pyplot and Searborn for data visualisation
Platform: Jupyter Notebook
