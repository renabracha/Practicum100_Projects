# Project Description

You’ve decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so you and your partners decide to try to attract investors. They’re interested in the current market conditions: will you be able to maintain your success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off? You have open-source data on restaurants in LA.

Perform some market research and prepare a presentation of the findings with insights.
