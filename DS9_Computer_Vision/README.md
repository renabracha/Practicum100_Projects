# Project Description

A supermarket chain is introducing a computer vision system for
processing customer photos. Photofixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to analyze purchases and offer products that may interest buyers in particular age groups, and to monitor clerks selling alcohol.

Build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. To help, you'll have a set of photographs of people with their ages indicated.

**Theme:** Computer Vision

Note: The image files were streamed from server.
