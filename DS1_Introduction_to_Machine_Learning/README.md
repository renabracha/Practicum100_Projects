# Project Description

A mobile carrier operator has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of the two newer plans. 

For this classification task, develop a model that will pick the right plan with the highest possible accuracy. In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75. Check the accuracy using the test dataset.
